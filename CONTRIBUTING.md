# Contributing to zopefoundation projects

The projects under the zopefoundation organization are open source and welcome
contributions in different forms:

* bug reports
* code improvements and bug fixes
* documentation improvements
* reviews of pull requests

For any changes in the repository besides trivial typo fixes you are required
you to sign a contributor agreement.
See https://www.zope.org/developer/becoming-a-committer.html for details.

## Contributing code changes

Once you are a contributor you can create branches inside the zopefoundation
repositories. Please use this ability as it makes it easier for the maintainers
to try out and make changes to your pull request. (This is not required for
your first pull request.)

See [Zope Development Culture](https://www.zope.org/developer/development-culture.html)
for details about coding standards.

Please try to write tests for your changes and fix the ones which got broken by
your changes. To do so please run the tests locally
(usually via [tox](https://pypi.org/project/tox/)).

Before merging your changes please wait for an approval of your pull request.
After it was approved by at least one other contributor, please merge the pull
request yourself to prove that you signed the contributor agreement and
therefore have the necessary merge permissions.
